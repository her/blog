# A playground blog written in Go

A super simple API ontop of a postgres database with a single model (Posts).
I wanted to play around with Golang and see what it felt like writing a basic CRUD-y service.
This is not ready for production (and may never be) and is just an example application.


### Requirements
 * Postgres with database `blog`
 * Go

TODO:
  * Make a frontend!
  * Write some tests ðŸ˜…

A post is a single entity. Posts contain the contents of a blog entry, a title, and an author.

  "Title": "A Blog Post",

  "Content": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
}
```

### Index
`GET /posts`

* **Path Parameters**
  * _None_
* **Query Parameters**
  * _None_

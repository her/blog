# A playground blog written in Go

A small API written in Go, using Postgres, with a single model (Posts).
I wanted to play around with Golang and see what it felt like writing a CRUD-y service.
This is not ready for production (and may never be) and is just an example application.

### Requirements
 * Postgres with database `blog`
 * Go
 * Some Go packages listed below

TODO:
  * Make a frontend!
  * Write some tests ðŸ˜…

## Installation and Setup
You need these packages:

```
go get -u github.com/gorilla/handlers
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
go get -u github.com/jinzhu/gorm
go get -u github.com/joho/godotenv
go get -u github.com/lib/pq
```

# Posts API
